Write a program that:
1. Computes the volume of the 5 Platonic solids of a given edge. The edge length must be
assigned to a variable. The program must compute and store in appropriate variables the
volumes of the 5 solids. The program must then print the name of each solid, followed by the
edge length and the corresponding volume. Let 𝑎 denote the edge.

2. Assigns the string “Exercise for evaluation” to a variable. The program must then compute
the string obtained by concatenating all odd characters of the string followed by all even
characters of the string (pay attention to the fact that in Python indexing starts from 0, while
in common language odd characters are the first, third and so on). The result must be stored
in a variable and then printed on screen.
